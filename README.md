This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## This project is meant to fetch the quotes from my Express js Motivational API

In order to bypass cors, the express API will only accept the origin @ localhost 3000. Make sure you are running the client on localhost 3000 to test this client interface
